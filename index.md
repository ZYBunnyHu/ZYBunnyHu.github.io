## Bio

I am an Oxford CSC-NDM Prize student with [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/), [Christopher Yau](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/yau) 
and [Ahmed Ahmed](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/ahmed-ahmed) at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/home) 
and at the [MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).

I am working on single cell methods for understanding ovarian cancer. I also work on computational methods for understanding the role of nonsense mediated decay in cancer.
