Research interest: Single-Cell Analysis, Ovarian Cancer, Genomics

I am working on single-cell methods for understanding ovarian cancer. I also work on computational methods for understanding the role of nonsense-mediated decay in cancer.

I recently passed my viva. I was an Oxford CSC-NDM Prize student with [Prof Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/), [Prof Christopher Yau](https://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Prof Ahmed Ahmed](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/ahmed-ahmed) at the [Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/home-cover-page) and at the [MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.
